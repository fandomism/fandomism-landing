# Fandomism

This repository hosts a minimal static landing page for **Fandomism**.

The site is intentionally simple — a single page serving as a public entry point and contact surface while broader research, writing, and projects take shape.

Built with plain HTML and CSS and deployed via GitHub Pages.
